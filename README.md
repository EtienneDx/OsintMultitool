# OSINT Multi-tools

This script is just a user interface combining **FinalRecon** and **LittleBrother** tools, and their GUI.

## Installation

To install, just clone the repo and the submodules, and execute the *setup.py* script:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/EtienneDx/OsintMultitools --recursive

cd OsintMultitools
python setup.py
````
After calling the *setup.py* script, a message might appear telling you to [install tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) to get the GUI to work.

If the message **does not** appear, it means tkinter is already installed on your machine.
